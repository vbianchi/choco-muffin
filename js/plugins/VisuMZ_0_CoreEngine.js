 * ============================================================================
 * Introduction
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * The Core Engine plugin is designed to fix any bugs that may have slipped
 * past RPG Maker MZ's source code and to give game devs more control over
 * RPG Maker MZ's various features, ranging from mechanics to aesthetics to
 * quality of life improvements.
 *
 * Features include all (but not limited to) the following:
 *
 * * Bug fixes for the problems existing in the RPG Maker MZ base code.
 * * Failsafes added for Script Call related event commands.
 * * Lots of Quality of Life Settings that can be activated through the
 *   Plugin Parameters.
 * * Control over the various Text Colors used throughout the game.
 * * Change up the maximum amount of gold carried, give it an icon attached to
 *   the label, and include text for overlap specifics.
 * * Preload images as the game boots up.
 * * Add specific background images for menus found throughout the game.
 * * A button assist window will appear at the top or bottom of the screen,
 *   detailing which buttons do what when inside a menu. This feature can be
 *   turned off.
 * * Choose which in-game battler parameters to display inside menus (ie ATK,
 *   DEF, AGI, etc.) and determine their maximum values, along with plenty of
 *   notetags to give more control over parameter, x-parameter, s-parameter
 *   bonuses through equipment, states, and other trait objects.
 * * Control over how the UI objects appear (such as the menu button, cancel
 *   button, left/right actor switch buttons).
 * * Reposition actors and enemies if the battle resolution is larger.
 * * Allow class names and nicknames to support text codes when displayed.
 * * Determine how windows behave in the game, if they will mask other windows,
 *   their line height properties, and more.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Requirements
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * This plugin is made for RPG Maker MZ. This will not work in other iterations
 * of RPG Maker.
 *
 * ------ Tier 0 ------
 *
 * This plugin is a Tier 0 plugin. Place it under other plugins of lower tier
 * value on your Plugin Manager list (ie: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). This is to ensure
 * that your plugins will have the best compatibility with the rest of the
 * VisuStella MZ Plugin library.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Important Changes: Bug Fixes
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * This plugin also serves to fix various bugs found in RPG Maker MZ that have
 * been unaddressed or not yet taken care of. The following is a list of bugs
 * that have been fixed by this plugin:
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Attack Skill Trait
 *
 * Enemies are unaffected by the Attack Skill Trait. This means if they have
 * an Attack action, they will always use Attack over and over even if their
 * Attack Skill Trait has been changed. This plugin will change it up so that
 * the Attack skill will comply with whatever their Attack Skill Trait's skill
 * is set to.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Auto Battle Actor Skill Usage
 *
 * If an actor with Auto Battle has access to a skill but not have any access
 * to that skill's type, that actor will still be able to use the skill during
 * Auto Battle despite the fact that the actor cannot use that skill during
 * manual input.
 *
 * ---
 * 
 * Auto Battle Attack Seal Bypass
 * 
 * By default, if the attack skill is sealed via a trait and an actor has
 * auto-battle, the action can still be used via auto-battle. This is now fixed
 * and actors should not be able to attack via auto-battle if their attack
 * ability is sealed.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * Auto Battle Lock Up
 * 
 * If an auto battle Actor fights against an enemy whose DEF/MDF is too high,
 * they will not use any actions at all. This can cause potential game freezing
 * and softlocks. This plugin will change that and have them default to a
 * regular Attack.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * Battle Forced End Action Crash
 * 
 * Depending on various circumstances, currently active battlers can be cleared
 * from the battle system at will due to a number of reasons. However, if it
 * just so happens that the targets are cleared, too, with actions remaining,
 * then a crash will follow up. This plugin will prevent that change. Fix made
 * by Olivia.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * Gamepad Repeat Input
 * 
 * Cleared inputs on gamepads do not have a downtime and will trigger the
 * following input frame. The causes problems with certain RPG Maker MZ menus
 * where the inputs have to be cleared as the next immediate frame will have
 * them inputted again. This plugin changes it so that whenever inputs are
 * cleared, there is a downtime equal to the keyboard clear frames before the
 * gamepad input is registered once more.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * Invisible Battle Sprites
 * 
 * If you removed a party member during battle and added that exact party
 * member back into the same slot, their sprite would appear invisible. The
 * VisuStella Core Engine will fix this problem and prevent it from happening.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * Instant Text Discrepancy for Window_Message
 * 
 * Window_Message displays text differently when it draws letters one by one
 * versus when the text is displayed instantly. This isn't noticeable with the
 * default font, but it's very visible when using something like Arial. The
 * error is due to Bitmap.measureTextWidth yielding a rounded value per letter
 * versus per word. The Core Engine will provide a bug fix that will single out
 * the cause and make it so that only Window_Message will not utilize any round
 * number values when determining the width of each letter, whether or not it
 * is shown instantly. This change will only affect Window_Message and not any
 * other window in order to prevent unintended side effects.
 * 
 * This can be disabled through the Plugin Parameters:
 * 
 * Plugin Parameters > QoL Settings > Misc > Font Width Fix
 * 
 * ---
 *
 * Move Picture, Origin Differences
 *
 * If a Show Picture event command is made with an Origin setting of
 * "Upper Left" and a Move Picture event command is made afterwards with an
 * Origin setting of "Center", RPG Maker MZ would originally have it instantly
 * jump into the new origin setting without making a clean transition between
 * them. This plugin will create that clean transition between origins.
 *
 * ---
 * 
 * Overly-Protective Substitute
 * 
 * When an ally with critical health is being targeted by a friendly non-
 * Certain Hit skill (such as a heal or buff) and another ally has the
 * substitute state, the other ally would "protect" the originally targeted
 * ally and take the heal or buff.
 * 
 * The new changed behavior is that now, substitute will not trigger for any
 * actions whose scope targets allies.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * Status Window Name Vertical Cutoffs
 * 
 * In the battle status windows, whenever actor names are displayed, the bitmap
 * used to display their name text do not extend vertically all the way,
 * causing letters like lowercase "Q" and "G" to be cut off, making them hard
 * to distinguish from one another. The Core Engine will remedy this by
 * extending the bitmap to allow enough room. Fix made by Irina.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * Termination Clear Effects
 * 
 * In RPG Maker MZ, requesting an animation while transitioning between
 * scenes, such as going from the map scene to the battle scene, can cause
 * crashes. This is because the animation queue does not take off immediately
 * and will likely register incorrect targets for the scene. This plugin will
 * forcefully clear any registered animations and balloon effects when
 * terminating a scene in order to prevent crashes.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * Timer Sprite
 * 
 * By default, RPG Maker MZ adds Sprite_Timer into its spriteset, either for
 * maps or for battles. There is one major problem with this: when spritesets
 * are affected by filters, zooms, and/or blurs, this hinders how readable the
 * timer sprite is, making the information perceived by the player to be much
 * harder than it needs to be. The Core Engine adds the sprite to the parent
 * scene instead of the spriteset to ensure it's unobscured by anything else.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * Unusable Battle Items
 * 
 * If any party member is able to use an item in battle, then all party members
 * are able to use said item, even if that party member is supposed to be
 * unable to use that item. This is now changed so that battle items are
 * checked on an individual basis and not on a party-wide basis.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * Window Arrows Sprite Tearing
 * 
 * If a window object in RPG Maker MZ were to have an odd number for width size
 * then the arrow elements found for the window would be positioned on a half
 * pixel, giving it a blurry look and also have sprite tearing issues. This is
 * now fixed by rounding the number to the nearest whole number.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * Window Client Area Scaling Bug
 * 
 * If the window has a scale value different from 1.0, the client area (the
 * interactable parts) will not scale properly and appear clipped out. This
 * is now fixed by adjusting the client area to the window's scale values and
 * rounding upward to the nearest whole number.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * Window Skin Bleeding
 * 
 * This bug is fixed in the core scripts for RPG Maker MZ v1.3.0+.
 * 
 * Since the v1.2.0 update, Window.prototype._refreshBack's frame value has
 * been set from 96 to 95. This results in the window skin bleeding past the
 * window's intended borders. The Core Engine now reverts this change to
 * prevent the bleeding effect from happening.
 * 
 * ---
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Major Changes: New Hard-Coded Features
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * This plugin adds some new hard-coded features to RPG Maker MZ's functions.
 * The following is a list of them.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Scroll-Linked Pictures
 *
 * - If a Parallax has a ! at the start of its filename, it is bound to the map
 * scrolling. The same thing now happens with pictures. If a Picture has a ! at
 * the start of its filename, it is bound to the map's scrolling as well.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Movement Route Scripts
 *
 * - If code in a Movement Route Script command fails, instead of crashing the
 * game, it will now act as if nothing happened except to display the cause of
 * the error inside the console.
 *
 * ---
 * 
 * Script Call Failsafes
 * 
 * - If code found in Conditional Branches, Control Variables, and/or Script
 * Calls fail to activate, instead of crashing the game, it will now act as if
 * nothing happened except to display the cause of the error inside the
 * console.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * Digit Grouping
 * 
 * - There exists an option to change how numbers are displayed and converted
 * in your game. This option can be enabled or disabled by going into the
 * Plugin Manager > VisuMZ_0_OptionsCore > Quality of Life Settings >
 * Digit Grouping and toggling on/off whichever ones you want.
 * 
 * - Digit Grouping will follow the rules of whatever country/locale the Plugin
 * Parameters are set to. If it's to default 'en-US', then 1234567.123456 will
 * become 1,234,567.123456. Set it to 'es-ES' and it becomes 1.234.567,123456
 * instead.
 * 
 * - This uses JavaScript's Number.toLocaleString() function and will therefore
 * follow whatever rules it has. This means if there are trailing zeroes at the
 * end of a decimal, it will cut them off. Numbers like 123.45000 will become
 * 123.45 instead. Excess numbers past 6 decimal places will be rounded. A
 * number like 0.123456789 will become 0.123457 instead.
 * 
 * - Numbers in between [ and ], < and > will be excluded from digit grouping
 * in order for text codes to be preserved accurately. \I[1234] will remain as
 * \I[1234].
 * 
 * - If you would like to enter in a number without digit grouping, surround it
 * with {{ and }}. Typing in {{1234567890}} will yield 1234567890.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * Show Scrolling Text, additional functionality
 * 
 * The event command "Show Scrolling Text" now has additional functionality as
 * long as the VisuStella MZ Core Engine is installed. If the game dev inserts
 * "// Script Call" (without the quotes) inside the scrolling text, then the
 * entirity of the Show Scrolling Text event command will be ran as a giant
 * script call event command.
 * 
 * The reason why this functionality is added is because the "Script..." event
 * command contains only 12 lines maximum. This means for any script call
 * larger than 12 lines of code cannot be done by normal means as each script
 * call is ran as a separate instance.
 * 
 * By repurposing the "Show Scrolling Text" event command to be able to
 * function as an extended "Script..." event command, such a thing is now
 * possible with less hassle and more lines to code with.
 * 
 * This effect does not occur if the Show Scrolling Text event command does not
 * have "// Script Call" in its contents.
 * 
 * ---
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Notetags
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * The following are notetags that have been added through this plugin. These
 * notetags will not work with your game if this plugin is OFF or not present.
 *
 * === Actors ===
 *
 * Parameter limits can be adjusted in the Plugin Parameters, but this won't
 * lift the ability to change the values of an actor's initial or max level
 * past the editor's limits. Instead, this must be done through the usage of
 * notetags to accomplish the feat.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * <Max Level: x>
 *
 * - Used for: Actor Notetags
 * - Replace 'x' with an integer to determine the actor's max level.
 * - This allows you to go over the database limit of 99.
 * - If this notetag isn't used, default to the actor's database value.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * <Initial Level: x>
 *
 * - Used for: Actor Notetags
 * - Replace 'x' with an integer to determine the actor's initial level.
 * - This allows you to go over the database limit of 99.
 * - If this notetag isn't used, default to the actor's database value.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * === Classes ===
 *
 * As actor levels can now surpass 99 due to the notetag system, there may be
 * some skills you wish certain classes can learn upon reaching higher levels
 * past 99, too.
 *
 * ---
 * 
 * <Learn At Level: x>
 *
 * - Used for: Class Skill Learn Notetags
 * - Replace 'x' with an integer to determine the level this class will learn
 *   the associated skill at.
 * - This allows you to go over the database limit of 99.
 * - If this notetag isn't used, default to the class's database value.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * === Enemies ===
 *
 * Enemies are now given levels. The levels don't do anything except to serve
 * as a container for a number value. This way, levels can be used in damage
 * formulas (ie. a.atk - b.level) without causing any errors. To give enemies
 * levels, use the notetags below. These notetags also allow you to adjust the
 * base parameters, EXP, and Gold past the database limitations.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * <Level: x>
 *
 * - Used for: Enemy Notetags
 * - Replace 'x' with an integer to determine the enemy's level.
 * - If no level is declared, the level will default to 1.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * <param: x>
 *
 * - Used for: Enemy Notetags
 * - Replace 'param' with 'MaxHP', 'MaxMP', 'ATK', 'DEF', 'MAT', 'MDF', 'AGI',
 *   or 'LUK' to determine which parameter to alter.
 *   - This notetag does NOT work with X Parameters, S Parameters, or any
 *     custom parameters. This notetag ONLY works with the base parameters.
 * - Replace 'x' with an integer to set an enemy's 'param' base value.
 * - This will overwrite the enemy's database value and can exceed the original
 *   value limitation in the database.
 * - If these notetags aren't used, default to the enemy's database value.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * <EXP: x>
 * <Gold: x>
 *
 * - Used for: Enemy Notetags
 * - Replace 'x' with an integer to determine the enemy's EXP or Gold values.
 * - This will overwrite the enemy's database value and can exceed the original
 *   value limitation in the database.
 * - If these notetags aren't used, default to the enemy's database value.
 *
 * ---
 * 
 * === Animations ===
 * 
 * Animations in RPG Maker MZ are done by Effekseer and the animation system
 * has been revamped. However, the animations are only centered on the targets
 * now, and cannot be attached to the head or foot. Insert these tags into
 * the names of the animations in the database to adjust their positions.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * <Head>
 * <Foot>
 * 
 * - Used for: Animation Name Tags
 * - Will set the animation to anchor on top of the sprite (if <Head> is used)
 *   or at the bottom of the sprite (if <Foot> is used).
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * <Anchor X: x>
 * <Anchor Y: y>
 * 
 * <Anchor: x, y>
 * 
 * - Used for: Animation Name Tags
 * - Will anchor the animation at a specific point within the sprite based on
 *   the 'x' and 'y' values.
 * - Replace 'x' and 'y' with numeric values representing their positions based
 *   on a rate where 0.0 is the furthest left/up (x, y respectively) to 1.0 for
 *   the furthest right/down (x, y respectively).
 * 
 * Examples:
 * 
 * <Anchor X: 0.4>
 * <Anchor Y: 0.8>
 * 
 * <Anchor: 0.2, 0.9>
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * <Offset X: +x>
 * <Offset X: -x>
 * <Offset Y: +y>
 * <Offset Y: -y>
 * 
 * <Offset: +x, +y>
 * <Offset: -x, -y>
 * 
 * - Used for: Animation Name Tags
 * - Will anchor the animation to be offset by an exact number of pixels.
 * - This does the same the editor does, except it lets you input values
 *   greater than 999 and lower than -999.
 * - Replace 'x' and 'y' with numeric values the exact number of pixels to
 *   offset the animation's x and y coordinates by.
 * 
 * Examples:
 * 
 * <Offset X: +20>
 * <Offset Y: -50>
 * 
 * <Offset: +10, -30>
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * <Mirror Offset X>
 * <No Mirror Offset X>
 * 
 * - Used for: Animation Name Tags
 * - If an animation is mirrored, you can choose to have the animation's Offset
 *   X value be mirrored, too (or not at all).
 * - If no name tag is discovered, this will use the setting found in the
 *   Plugin Parameters > QoL Settings > Misc > Ani: Mirror Offset X setting.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * <Rate: x>
 * 
 * - Used for: MV Animation Name Tags
 * - Allows you to adjust the update for this MV Animation.
 *   - Does NOT work with Effekseer animations.
 * - The lower the number, the faster.
 * - Replace 'x' with a number representing the animation update rate.
 *   - Default rate: 4.
 *   - Minimum rate: 1.
 *   - Maximum rate: 10.
 * 
 * ---
 *
 * === Quality of Life ===
 *
 * By default, RPG Maker MZ does not offer an encounter step minimum after a
 * random encounter has finished. This means that one step immediately after
 * finishing a battle, the player can immediately enter another battle. The
 * Quality of Life improvement: Minimum Encounter Steps allows you to set a
 * buffer range between battles for the player to have some breathing room.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * <Minimum Encounter Steps: x>
 *
 * - Used for: Map Notetags
 * - Replace 'x' with the minimum number of steps before the player enters a
 *   random encounter on that map.
 * - If this notetag is not used, then the minimum encounter steps for the map
 *   will default to Quality of Life Settings => Encounter Rate Min.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Tile shadows are automatically added to certain tiles in the map editor.
 * These tile shadows may or may not fit some types of maps. You can turn them
 * on/off with the Quality of Life Plugin Parameters or you can override the
 * settings with the following notetags:
 *
 * ---
 *
 * <Show Tile Shadows>
 * <Hide Tile Shadows>
 *
 * - Used for: Map Notetags
 * - Use the respective notetag for the function you wish to achieve.
 * - If this notetag is not used, then the minimum encounter steps for the map
 *   will default to Quality of Life Settings => No Tile Shadows.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * === Basic, X, and S Parameters ===
 *
 * A battler's parameters, or stats as some devs know them as, are the values
 * that determine how a battler performs. These settings allow you to alter
 * behaviors and give boosts to trait objects in a more controlled manner.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * <param Plus: +x>
 * <param Plus: -x>
 *
 * - Used for: Actor, Class, Weapon, Armor, Enemy, State Notetags

 *
 * ---
 *
 * <param Max: x>
 *
 * - Used for: Actor, Class, Weapon, Armor, Enemy, State Notetags

 *   available to the unit, then the highest will be selected.
 * - Replace 'param' with 'MaxHP', 'MaxMP', 'ATK', 'DEF', 'MAT', 'MDF', 'AGI',
 *   or 'LUK' to determine which parameter to modify.

 * Plugin Parameters: Color Settings
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * These settings allow you, the game dev, to have more control over which
 * colors appear for what conditions found in the game. You can use regular
 * numbers to use the colors predetermined by the game's Window Skin or you
 * can use the #rrggbb format for a hex color code.
 * 
 * If the game's Window Skin is changed mid-game, the colors used will still be
 * based off the default Window Skin's colors. This is due to storing them in a
 * cache and preventing extra processing and reduces lag.
 *
 * You can find out what hex codes belong to which color from this website:
 * https://htmlcolorcodes.com/
 *

 * ============================================================================
 * Plugin Parameters: Parameter Settings
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * A battler's parameters, or stats as some devs know them as, are the values
 * that determine how a battler performs. These settings allow you to alter
 * their behaviors and give boosts to trait objects in a controlled manner.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Parameter Settings
 *
 *   Displayed Parameters
 *   - A list of the parameters that will be displayed in-game.
 *   - Shown in the Equip Menu.
 *   - Shown in the Status Menu.
 *
 *   Extended Parameters
 *   - The list shown in extended scenes (for other VisuStella plugins).
 *
 * ---
 *
 * === Basic Parameters ===
 *
 * MHP - MaxHP
 * - This is the maximum health points value. The amount of health points (HP)
 * a battler has determines whether or not the battler is in a living state or
 * a dead state. If the HP value is above 0, then the battler is living. If it
 * is 0 or below, the battler is in a dead state unless the battler has a way
 * to counteract death (usually through immortality). When the battler takes
 * damage, it is usually dealt to the HP value and reduces it. If the battler
 * is healed, then the HP value is increased. The MaxHP value determines what's
 * the maximum amount the HP value can be held at, meaning the battler cannot
 * be healed past that point.
 *
 * MMP - MaxMP
 * - This is the maximum magic points value. Magic points (MP) are typically
 * used for the cost of skills and spells in battle. If the battler has enough
 * MP to fit the cost of the said skill, the battler is able to use the said
 * skill provided that all of the skill's other conditions are met. If not, the
 * battler is then unable to use the skill. Upon using a skill that costs MP,
 * the battler's MP is reduced. However, the battler's MP can be recovered and
 * results in a gain of MP. The MaxMP value determines what is the maximum
 * amount the MP value can be held at, meaning the battler cannot recover MP
 * past the MaxMP value.
 *
 * ATK - Attack
 * - This is the attack value of the battler. By default, this stat is used for
 * the purpose of damage calculations only, and is typically used to represent
 * the battler's physical attack power. Given normal damage formulas, higher
 * values mean higher damage output for physical attacks.
 *
 * DEF - Defense
 * - This is the defense value of the battler. By default, this stat is used
 * for the purpose of damage calculations only, and is typically used to
 * represent the battler's physical defense. Given normal damage formulas,
 * higher values mean less damage received from physical attacks.
 *
 * MAT - Magic Attack
 * - This is the magic attack value of the battler. By default, this stat is
 * used for the purpose of damage calculations only, and is typically used to
 * represent the battler's magical attack power. Given normal damage formulas,
 * higher values mean higher damage output for magical attacks.
 *
 * MDF - Magic Defense
 * - This is the magic defense value of the battler. By default, this stat is
 * used for the purpose of damage calculations only, and is typically used to
 * represent the battler's magical defense. Given normal damage formulas,
 * higher values mean less damage received from magical attacks.
 *
 * AGI - Agility
 * - This is the agility value of the battler. By default, this stat is used to
 * determine battler's position in the battle turn's order. Given a normal turn
 * calculation formula, the higher the value, the faster the battler is, and
 * the more likely the battler will have its turn earlier in a turn.
 *
 * LUK - Luck
 * - This is the luck value of the battler. By default, this stat is used to
 * affect the success rate of states, buffs, and debuffs applied by the battler
 * and received by the battler. If the user has a higher LUK value, the state,
 * buff, or debuff is more likely to succeed. If the target has a higher LUK
 * value, then the state, buff, or debuff is less likely to succeed.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Basic Parameters
 *
 *   HP Crisis Rate:
 *   - HP Ratio at which a battler can be considered in crisis mode.
 *
 *   JS: Formula:
 *   - Formula used to determine the total value all 8 basic parameters:
 *   - MaxHP, MaxMP, ATK, DEF, MAT, MDF, AGI, LUK.
 *
 * Parameter Caps:
 *
 *   MaxHP Cap:
 *   MaxMP Cap:
 *   ATK Cap:
 *   DEF Cap:
 *   MAT Cap:
 *   MDF Cap:
 *   AGI Cap:
 *   LUK Cap:
 *   - Formula used to determine the selected parameter's cap.
 *   - These settings DO NOT raise the editor's maximum values. If you want to
 *     raise an enemy's maximum parameter value past their default cap, use the
 *     associated notetag for them instead.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * === X Parameters ===
 *
 * HIT - Hit Rate%
 * - This determines the physical hit success rate of the any physical action.
 * All physical attacks make a check through the HIT rate to see if the attack
 * will connect. If the HIT value passes the randomizer check, the attack will
 * connect. If the HIT value fails to pass the randomizer check, the attack
 * will be considered a MISS.
 *
 * EVA - Evasion Rate%
 * - This determines the physical evasion rate against any incoming physical
 * actions. If the HIT value passes, the action is then passed to the EVA check
 * through a randomizer check. If the randomizer check passes, the physical
 * attack is evaded and will fail to connect. If the randomizer check passes,
 * the attempt to evade the action will fail and the action connects.
 *
 * CRI - Critical Hit Rate%
 * - Any actions that enable Critical Hits will make a randomizer check with
 * this number. If the randomizer check passes, extra damage will be carried
 * out by the initiated action. If the randomizer check fails, no extra damage
 * will be added upon the action.
 *
 * CEV - Critical Evasion Rate%
 * - This value is put against the Critical Hit Rate% in a multiplicative rate.
 * If the Critical Hit Rate is 90% and the Critical Evasion Rate is
 * 20%, then the randomizer check will make a check against 72% as the values
 * are calculated by the source code as CRI * (1 - CEV), therefore, with values
 * as 0.90 * (1 - 0.20) === 0.72.
 *
 * MEV - Magic Evasion Rate%
 * - Where EVA is the evasion rate against physical actions, MEV is the evasion
 * rate against magical actions. As there is not magical version of HIT, the
 * MEV value will always be bit against when a magical action is initiated. If
 * the randomizer check passes for MEV, the magical action will not connect. If
 * the randomizer check fails for MEV, the magical action will connect.
 *
 * MRF - Magic Reflect Rate%
 * - If a magical action connects and passes, there is a chance the magical
 * action can be bounced back to the caster. That chance is the Magic Reflect
 * Rate. If the randomizer check for the Magic Reflect Rate passes, then the
 * magical action is bounced back to the caster, ignoring the caster's Magic
 * Evasion Rate. If the randomizer check for the Magic Reflect Rate fails, then
 * the magical action will connect with its target.
 *
 * CNT - Counter Attack Rate%
 * - If a physical action connects and passes, there is a chance the physical
 * action can be avoided and a counter attack made by the user will land on the
 * attacking unit. This is the Counter Attack Rate. If the randomizer check for
 * the Counter Attack Rate passes, the physical action is evaded and the target
 * will counter attack the user. If the randomizer check fails, the physical
 * action will connect to the target.
 *
 * HRG - HP% Regeneration
 * - During a battler's regeneration phase, the battler will regenerate this
 * percentage of its MaxHP as gained HP with a 100% success rate.
 *
 * MRG - MP% Regeneration
 * - During a battler's regeneration phase, the battler will regenerate this
 * percentage of its MaxMP as gained MP with a 100% success rate.
 *
 * TRG - TP% Regeneration
 * - During a battler's regeneration phase, the battler will regenerate this
 * percentage of its MaxTP as gained TP with a 100% success rate.
 *
 * ---
 *

 * ---
 *
 * === S Parameters ===
 *
 * TGR - Target Rate
 * - Against the standard enemy, the Target Rate value determines the odds of
 * an enemy specifically targeting the user for a single target attack. At 0%,
 * the enemy will almost never target the user. At 100%, it will have normal
 * targeting opportunity. At 100%+, the user will have an increased chance of
 * being targeted.
 * *NOTE: For those using the Battle A.I. Core, any actions that have specific
 * target conditions will bypass the TGR rate.
 *
 * GRD - Guard Effect
 * - This is the effectiveness of guarding. This affects the guard divisor
 * value of 2. At 100% GRD, damage will become 'damage / (2 * 1.00)'. At 50%
 * GRD, damage will become 'damage / (2 * 0.50)'. At 200% GRD, damage will
 * become 'damage / (2 * 2.00)' and so forth.
 *
 * REC - Recovery Effect
 * - This is how effective heals are towards the user. The higher the REC rate,
 * the more the user is healed. If a spell were to heal for 100 and the user
 * has 300% REC, then the user is healed for 300 instead.
 *
 * PHA - Pharmacology
 * - This is how effective items are when used by the user. The higher the PHA
 * rate, the more effective the item effect. If the user is using a Potion that
 * recovers 100% on a target ally and the user has 300% PHA, then the target
 * ally will receive healing for 300 instead.
 *
 * MCR - MP Cost Rate
 * - This rate affects how much MP skills with an MP Cost will require to use.
 * If the user has 100% MCR, then the MP Cost will be standard. If the user has
 * 50% MCR, then all skills that cost MP will cost only half the required MP.
 * If the user has 200% MCR, then all skills will cost 200% their MP cost.
 *
 * TCR - TP Charge Rate
 * - This rate affects how much TP skills with an TP will charge when gaining
 * TP through various actions. At 100%, TP will charge normally. At 50%, TP
 * will charge at half speed. At 200%, TP will charge twice as fast.
 *
 * PDR - Physical Damage Rate
 * - This rate affects how much damage the user will take from physical damage.
 * If the user has 100% PDR, then the user takes the normal amount. If the user
 * has 50% PDR, then all physical damage dealt to the user is halved. If the
 * user has 200% PDR, then all physical damage dealt to the user is doubled.
 *
 * MDR - Magical Damage Rate
 * - This rate affects how much damage the user will take from magical damage.
 * If the user has 100% MDR, then the user takes the normal amount. If the user
 * has 50% MDR, then all magical damage dealt to the user is halved. If the
 * user has 200% MDR, then all magical damage dealt to the user is doubled.
 *
 * FDR - Floor Damage Rate
 * - On the field map, this alters how much damage the user will take when the
 * player walks over a tile that damages the party. The FDR value only affects
 * the damage dealt to the particular actor and not the whole party. If FDR is
 * at 100%, then the user takes the full damage. If FDR is at 50%, then only
 * half of the damage goes through. If FDR is at 200%, then floor damage is
 * doubled for that actor.
 *
 * EXR - Experience Rate
 * - This determines the amount of experience gain the user whenever the user
 * gains any kind of EXP. At 100% EXR, the rate of experience gain is normal.
 * At 50%, the experience gain is halved. At 200%, the experience gain for the
 * user is doubled.

 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Plugin Parameters: Custom Parameters Settings
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * As of version 1.07, you can add Custom Parameters to your game if RPG Maker
 * MZ's default set of parameters isn't enough for you. These parameters can
 * have variable functionality depending on how you code it. More importantly,
 * these are compatible with the VisuStella MZ menus and the VisuStella Core
 * Engine's Parameters settings.
 * 
 * For clarification, these settings do NOT create brand-new parameters for you
 * to use and add to your game nor are the bonuses supported by other plugins
 * in the VisuStella MZ library. These settings exist to function as a bridge
 * for non-VisuStella MZ plugins that have created their own parameter values
 * and to show them inside VisuStella menus.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Custom Parameter
 * 
 *   Parameter Name:
 *   - What's the parameter's name?
 *   - Used for VisuStella MZ menus.
 * 
 *   Abbreviation:
 *   - What abbreviation do you want to use for the parameter?
 *   - Do not use special characters. Avoid numbers if possible.
 * 
 *   Icon:
 *   - What icon do you want to use to represent this parameter?
 *   - Used for VisuStella MZ menus.
 * 
 *   Type:
 *   - What kind of number value will be returned with this parameter?
 *     - Integer (Whole Numbers Only)
 *     - Float (Decimals are Allowed)
 * 
 *   JS: Value:
 *   - Run this code when this parameter is to be returned.
 *
 * ---
 * 
 * Instructions on Adding Custom Parameters to VisuStella Menus
 * 
 * In the Core Engine and Elements and Status Menu Core plugins, there are
 * plugin parameter fields for you to insert the parameters you want displayed
 * and visible to the player.
 * 
 * Insert in those the abbreviation of the custom parameter. For example, if
 * you want to add the "Strength" custom parameter and the abbreviation is
 * "str", then add "str" to the Core Engine/Elements and Status Menu Core's
 * plugin parameter field for "Strength" to appear in-game. Case does not
 * matter here so you can insert "str" or "STR" and it will register all the
 * same to make them appear in-game.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * Instructions on Using Custom Parameters as Mechanics
 * 
 * If you want to use a custom parameter in, say, a damage formula, refer to
 * the abbreviation you have set for the custom parameter. For example, if you
 * want to call upon the "Strength" custom parameter's value and its set
 * abbreviation is "str", then refer to it as such. This is case sensitive.
 * 
 * An example damage formula would be something like the following if using
 * "str" for "Strength" and "con" for "Constitution":
 * 
 *   a.str - b.con
 * 
 * These values are attached to the Game_Battlerbase prototype class.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * Instructions on Setting Custom Parameter Values
 * 
 * This requires JavaScript knowledge. There is no way around it. Whatever code
 * you insert into the "JS: Value" field will return the value desired. The
 * 'user' variable will refer to the Game_Battlerbase prototype object in which
 * the information is to be drawn from.
 * 
 * Depending on the "type" you've set for the Custom Parameter, the returned
 * value will be rounded using Math.round for integers and left alone if set as
 * a float number.
 *

 * ============================================================================
 * Plugin Parameters: Screen Resolution Settings
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Alter various properties to make the game look better for varying screen
 * resolutions. This is mostly for RPG Maker MZ version 1.3.0 and up where the

 *       RPG Maker MZ 1.3.0+.
 *     - If the Core Script is below 1.3.0, this setting is ignored. This does
 *       not take into account what version the editor is on. Pay attention to
 *       that as the plugin will not auto adjust for it.

 * Plugin Parameters: JS: Quick Functions
 * ============================================================================
 * 
 * WARNING: This feature is highly experimental! Use it at your own risk!
 * 
 * JavaScript Quick Functions allow you to quickly declare functions in the
 * global namespace for ease of access. It's so that these functions can be
 * used in Script Calls, Control Variable Script Inputs, Conditional Branch
 * Script Inputs, Damage Formulas, and more.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * JS: Quick Function
 * 
 *   Function Name:
 *   - The function's name in the global namespace.
 *   - Will not overwrite functions/variables of the same name.
 * 
 *   JS: Code:
 *   - Run this code when using the function.

 * ---
 * 
 * If you have a Function Name of "Example", then typing "Example()" in a
 * Script Call, Conditional Branch Script Input, or similar field will yield
 * whatever the code is instructed to return.
 * 
 * If a function or variable of a similar name already exists in the global
 * namespace, then the quick function will be ignored and not created.
 * 
 * If a quick function contains bad code that would otherwise crash the game,
 * a fail safe has been implemented to prevent it from doing so, display an
 * error log, and then return a 0 value.

 * *** Overly-Protective Substitute
 * *** When an ally with critical health is being targeted by a friendly non-

 * ** Added line to Plugin Command: "System: Battle System Change":
 * *** Some battle systems REQUIRE their specific plugins!
 * ** Added lines to "Plugin Parameters: Battle System":
 * *** Some battle systems REQUIRE their specific plugins! This means if you do

 * 
 * Version 1.45: September 17, 2021
 * * Bug Fixes!
 * ** Fixed a problem with "Picture: Coordinates Mode" to properly utilize the
 *    correct picture ID. Fix made by Arisu.
 * ** RPG Maker MZ Bug Fix:
 * *** Instant Text Discrepancy for Window_Message
 * **** Window_Message displays text differently when it draws letters one by
 *      one versus when the text is displayed instantly. This isn't noticeable
 *      with the default font, but it's very visible when using something like
 *      Arial. The error is due to Bitmap.measureTextWidth yielding a rounded
 *      value per letter versus per word. The Core Engine will provide a bug
 *      fix that will single out the cause and make it so that only
 *      Window_Message will not utilize any round number values when
 *      determining the width of each letter, whether or not it is shown
 *      instantly. This change will only affect Window_Message and not any
 *      other window in order to prevent unintended side effects.

 * 
 * Version 1.42: July 16, 2021
 * * Documentation Update
 * ** Added text to "Plugin Parameters: Color Settings" for clarification:
 * *** If the game's Window Skin is changed mid-game, the colors used will
 *     still be based off the default Window Skin's colors. This is due to
 *     storing them in a cache and preventing extra processing and reduces lag.
 * 
 * Version 1.41: July 2, 2021
 * * Compatibility Update
 * ** Further compatibility update with RPG Maker MZ 1.3.0+.
 * * Documentation Update
 * ** Added extra notes to "Important Changes: Bug Fixes" section for the
 *    "Window Skin Bleeding" bug:

 * * Compatibility Update
 * ** Compatibility update with RPG Maker MZ 1.3.0+.

 * ** Window Skin Bleeding fix updated to newest version.
 * * New Plugin Parameters added:

 *      tab has been updated to match the screen resolution settings found in
 *      the System 2 Database tab.
 * *** Reposition Enemies > For MZ 1.3.0+?
 * **** Both of these plugin parameters need to be set to true in order for the
 *      repositioning to work for MZ v1.3.0.
 * **** If the Core Script is below 1.3.0, this setting is ignored. This does
 *      not take into account what version the editor is on. Pay attention to
 *      that as the plugin will not auto adjust for it.
 *

 * * Bug Fixes!
 * ** Number Inputs should now work with the controller if keyboard Number
 *    Input is enabled. Fix made by Olivia.
 * ** RPG Maker Bug: Termination Clear Effects
 * *** In RPG Maker MZ, requesting an animation while transitioning between
 *     scenes, such as going from the map scene to the battle scene, can cause
 *     crashes. This is because the animation queue does not take off
 *     immediately and will likely register incorrect targets for the scene.
 *     This plugin will forcefully clear any registered animations and balloon
 *     effects when terminating a scene in order to prevent crashes.
 * * Documentation Update!

 * *** Switches: Randomize ID(s)
 * *** Switches: Randomize Range

 *      parse and export them as a TXT file. Useful for getting a game's script
 *      to a voice actor or voice actress.
 * 
 * Version 1.35: May 7, 2021
 * * Documentation Update!
 * ** Added the following text to "Parameter Settings" Plugin Parameters for
 *    extra clarity regarding Parameter Caps:

 *     associated notetag for them instead.
 * 
 * Version 1.34: April 23, 2021
 * * Bug Fixes!
 * ** For the vanilla Equip Status window, custom parameters with integer
 *    values will now show up as integers and not percentiles. Fix by Olivia.
 * * Documentation Update!
 * ** Added clarity to the <param: x> notetag for enemies.
 * *** This notetag does NOT work with X Parameters, S Parameters, or any
 *     custom parameters. This notetag ONLY works with the base parameters.
 * 
 * Version 1.33: April 9, 2021
 * * Bug Fixes!
 * ** RPG Maker MZ Bug: Window Skin Bleeding
 * *** Since the v1.2.0 update, Window.prototype._refreshBack's frame value has
 *     been set from 96 to 95. This results in the window skin bleeding past
 *     the window's intended borders. The Core Engine now reverts this change
 *     to prevent the bleeding effect from happening.
 * * Feature Update!
 * ** "Encounter Rate Minimum" now has a valid minimum value of 1. Update made
 *    by Olivia.
 *

 * *** Plugin Parameters > QoL Settings > Battle Test > Add Weapon Type
 * *** Plugin Parameters > QoL Settings > Battle Test > Add Armor Type
 * *** Plugin Parameters > QoL Settings > Battle Test > Added Quantity
 * **** By default, RPG Maker MZ only adds 99 of items and not weapons or armor
 *      making it awkward for testing specific battle mechanics. These settings
 *      allow you to add in custom amounts of items, weapons, and/or armors if
 *      you so wish.
 * 
 * Version 1.31: March 26, 2021
 * * Feature Update!
 * ** Title screen buttons will now become fully opaque when hovered over them
 *    instead of only when pressed. Update made by Yanfly.
 * 
 * Version 1.30: March 19, 2021
 * * Bug Fixes!
 * ** RPG Maker MZ Bug: Invisible Battle Sprites
 * *** If you removed a party member during battle and added that exact party
 *     member back into the same slot, their sprite would appear invisible. The
 *     VisuStella Core Engine will fix this problem and prevent it from
 *     happening. Fix made by Olivia.
 * * Compatibility Update
 * ** Added compatibility functionality for future plugins.
 * * Documentation Update!
 * ** Help file updated for new features.
 * * New Features!
 * ** New Plugin Parameter added by Arisu:
 * *** Plugin Parameters > QoL Settings > Misc > Ani: Mirror Offset
 * **** When animations are mirrored, mirror their Offset X values, too.
 * ** New animation name tags added by Arisu:
 * *** <Mirror Offset X> and <No Mirror Offset X>
 * **** If these text tags are placed in an animation's name, it will cause the
 *      offset X value to be mirrored when the animation is mirrored or have it
 *      ignored despite being mirrored.
 * 
 * Version 1.29: March 12, 2021
 * * Bug Fixes!
 * ** RPG Maker MZ Bug: Interactable window client area does not conform to the
 *    window's declared scale when the scale is anything but 1.0. This will now
 *    be fixed through this plugin. Fix made by Olivia.
 * * Documentation Update!
 * ** Added documentation for new RPG Maker MZ bug fixes!
 * ** Help file updated for updated features.
 * * Feature Update!
 * ** Name Input should be more controller-friendly. If a controller is
 *    connected upon entering the name change scene, it will use the default
 *    manual-entry mode instead of the keyboard-entry mode. If a controller
 *    button is pressed during the keyboard-entry mode, it will automatically
 *    switch to the manual-entry mode.
 * ** This plugin does not provide support for controllers that are undetected
 *    by RPG Maker MZ's default controller support.
 * ** This feature was already implemented since version 1.27 but wasn't
 *    documented so here we are. Update made by Irina.
 * 
 * Version 1.28: March 5, 2021
 * * Bug Fixes!
 * ** RPG Maker MZ Bug: The arrows drawn by a window skin will no longer by
 *    placed on a half pixel when a window's size is an odd number. This would
 *    cause sprite tearing problems and look awful. Fix made by Irina.
 * * Documentation Update!
 * ** Added documentation for new RPG Maker MZ bug fixes!
 * 
 * Version 1.27: February 26, 2021

 *    Fixes to Major Changes as it was placed in the wrong section.
 * * New Features!
 * ** New Plugin Parameter added by Yanfly.
 * *** Plugin Parameters > Keyboard Input > Name Input > Banned Words
 * **** Insert words you don't want your players to use for character names.
 * 
 * Version 1.26: February 19, 2021
 * * Bug Fixes!
 * ** Certain Plugin Parameters no longer have settings that restrict them to
 *    a maximum of 1. Fix made by Arisu.
 * * Feature Update!
 * ** Changed the default value for a New Game > Common Event upon Play Testing
 *    to 0 to prevent confusion. Update made by Arisu.
 * 
 * Version 1.25: February 5, 2021
 * * Documentation Update!
 * ** Help file updated for new features.
 * * New Features!
 * ** Show Scrolling Text, additional functionality added by Arisu
 * *** The event command "Show Scrolling Text" now has additional functionality
 *     as long as the VisuStella MZ Core Engine is installed. If the game dev
 *     inserts "// Script Call" (without the quotes) inside the scrolling text,
 *     then the entirity of the Show Scrolling Text event command will be ran
 *     as a giant script call event command.
 * *** The reason why this functionality is added is because the "Script..."
 *     event command contains only 12 lines maximum. This means for any script
 *     call larger than 12 lines of code cannot be done by normal means as each
 *     script call is ran as a separate instance.
 * *** By repurposing the "Show Scrolling Text" event command to be able to
 *     function as an extended "Script..." event command, such a thing is now
 *     possible with less hassle and more lines to code with.
 * *** This effect does not occur if the Show Scrolling Text event command does
 *     not have "// Script Call" in its contents.
 * 
 * Version 1.24: January 29, 2021
 * * Documentation Update!
 * ** Plugin Parameters: Custom Parameters Settings added the following note:
 * *** For clarification, these settings do NOT create brand-new parameters for
 *     you to use and add to your game nor are the bonuses supported by other
 *     plugins in the VisuStella MZ library. These settings exist to function
 *     as a bridge for non-VisuStella MZ plugins that have created their own
 *     parameter values and to show them inside VisuStella menus.
 * * Feature Update!
 * ** Default JS Plugin Parameter for the Title Command: "Shutdown" now has a
 *    note in it that reads: "Do NOT use this command with mobile devices or
 *    browser games. All it does is cause the game to display a blank, black
 *    canvas which the player is unable to do anything with. It does NOT force
 *    close the browser tab nor the app."
 * *** This is also why this command is disabled by default for any non-NodeJS
 *     client deployed game versions.
 * ** Disabled some bug fixes made by the Core Engine for the default RMMZ code
 *    base since the 1.1.1 version now contains those very same fixes.

 * *** If an auto battle Actor fights against an enemy whose DEF/MDF is too

 *     replace them. We apologize for the inconvenience.
 * * New Features!

 * 
 * Version 1.03: September 6, 2020
